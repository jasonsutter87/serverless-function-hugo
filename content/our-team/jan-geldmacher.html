        <p> Counting years and career steps has never been important to me, though there are many by now. What has thrilled me since the start of my professional life are the challenges that forced me to jump into cold water again and again.</p>
        <p>Learning sales from scratch, having the humbling - and enlightening - experience of failing and finally feeling the joy of success are some of the vital things my first job taught me.</p>
        <p>Starting up a new business in telecoms after the liberalization of the Telekom monopoly in Germany in the 1990s was a great experience.</p>
        <p>Jumping into the opportunity of building a truly global network infrastructure, negotiating with dozens of suppliers around the world and finally operating a business-critical global telecommunications network, shaped my understanding of customer needs.</p>
        <p>Turning around heavy loss-making businesses, building successful senior management teams, generating reliable and healthy growth journeys, founding new business units, shaping the success of companies in the B2B space, and fundamentally understanding and serving customer needs is what made me the person and manager I am today.</p>
        <p>Being part of the venture capital world is exciting to me. I feel like I’m part of a team of truffle pigs tracking down and unearthing the treasures in technology and the teams of entrepreneurs making them possible. I enjoy supporting them on their journey - I get to put my own trove of knowledge, experience and professional network to work for their benefit. Collaborating together and combining our respective talents and experience helps drive innovation as well as professional growth.</p>
        <p>Today we are facing unprecedented challenges throughout the world. Technology can be one of the best tools to help us solve problems, big or small. It will indelibly shape our future and I’m humbled and excited to be a small part of that change!</p
