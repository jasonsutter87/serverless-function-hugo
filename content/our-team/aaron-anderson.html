        <p>Aaron is a principal at Impact Venture Capital, where he manages deal flow analysis, corporate engagement, and the innovation programs. He joined the team in 2015 and is passionate about working with corporates, governments, and, of course, startups to solve major global challenges with the goal of helping these companies compete successfully around the world, while maintaining high and rising living standards here at home. Aaron also teaches entrepreneurship at UC Davis.</p>
        <p>Prior to Impact, Aaron served as a Harvard Business School Leadership Fellow and as the Director of Business Initiatives for Mayor Kevin Johnson in Sacramento. In this role, he led the Mayorâ€™s workforce and economic development and public-private partnership initiatives.</p>
        <p>Aaron is a very proud father of three and loves college football, the mountains, and any activity that his wife, Elena, finds to keep him in some semblance of good shape. He serves as the Bishop of his local church congregation and considers himself something of a root beer aficionado. He graduated from Harvard Business School in 2013 and Brigham Young University in 2008.</p>
