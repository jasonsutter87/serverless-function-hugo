        <p>We deliberately assembled our team to take advantage of our investment thesis and maximize the value we add to our portfolio companies. Our investment committee has deep experience in corporate venture capital, entrepreneurship, traditional venture investing, academia, and public policy.  This allows us to add value in several key ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Our corporate relationships deliver exceptional co-investment opportunities, complete with powerful market insight and accelerated exit opportunities.</li>
          <li>Our empathy for founders and the entrepreneurial journey allows us to anticipate the pitfalls founders face and de-risk investment opportunities.  Our networks are a shot in the arm to early-stage founders.</li>
          <li>Our understanding of the forces shaping technology and industry today helps us foresee great investment opportunities others might miss.</li>
