        <h4>We are <span class="primary-text">reinventing venture capital</span> through active corporate collaboration.</h4>
        <p>Whether it’s pre-seed, seed, or Series A, we’re investing in some of the world’s greatest up-and-coming AI founders who are just getting started. Alongside top corporate venture groups, we work feverishly to identify, capitalize, and support the next generation of world-class artificial intelligence startups. Our founders are solving big problems, so we do all we can to accelerate their growth. With corporate, research, and government partners on hand, we empower entrepreneurs to dream big, . . . And to execute.</p>

        <h4><span class="primary-text">What we invest in, what we look for, and what to expect</span> </h4>
        <ol>
          <li><span class="primary-text">We are an early-stage firm that invests in artificial intelligence startups targeting the DeepTech, Enterprise/SaaS, Infrastructure, and Consumer spaces.</span> We lead and co-lead seed-stage investments. Then we roll up our sleeves to get founders to Series A. We help founders in four key areas: product-market fit, go-to-market strategy, recruiting, and fundraising. We love seasoned, successful entrepreneurs but we are equally enthusiastic about first-time founders that have something to prove. We love it when founders have a chip on their shoulders and a fire in their bellies! </li>
          <li>Because we invest early, we put a massive emphasis on the quality of the team.  We are looking for founders that are great operators.  They’re ambitious, competitive, gritty, and passionate.  They’re also empathetic, ethical, and humble.  They listen well, take prudent risks, and have wicked senses of humor :)  We believe that in order to win, these traits are not just “nice to have”, but are paramount!</li>
          <li>Our check sizes range from $250K to $1M for an initial investment. We will often make follow-on investments in companies that show <span class="primary-text">product market fit, rapid growth, and the potential to have outsized returns.</span>  We work feverishly to try to get all of our companies to these benchmarks. We are not a “set and forget “ firm. We roll our sleeves up and take great pride in building the company with you. We have a deep bench of Venture Advisors with extremely diverse backgrounds ready to be called into action at any time.</li>
