## Hybrid-Electric Drive System

A lightweight chassis and electric drive system glide precisely and efficiently on top of the soil – rain or shine.

## Autonomous Navigation

Our tractors drive autonomously while working, allowing growers to scale operations with minimal human intervention.

## Robotic Arm

With a long reach and a gentle touch, our rugged and reliable robotic arms have been designed for hard work on the ranch.

## Soft, Food-Safe Gripper

Food-safe grippers gently (and quickly) pick fruit from plants.

## Autonomous Fruit Tray Stacking

Our harvesters store hundreds of pounds of fresh fruit on board so you can save valuable time otherwise spent walking, loading and unloading.

## Rugged Stereo Camera

A custom, rugged stereo camera designed for the outdoors allows our robots to decide what is ripe and ready to pick – dozens of times per second.

## CVML Stack

Every berry is different. So, we trained a machine learning model to tell us which berries to pick, and how best to pick them. The best part? We get better with every berry we see.

## Software Emulator

Part of being the world’s leading farm robotics company is building a best-in-class software stack. Our software emulator mirrors real-world field conditions in a virtual environment, making it easier to test new features that improve performance and reliability before upgrading our equipment in the field.

## Product Reliability

Our machines are battle-tested in the field, with tens of thousands of runtime hours on strawberry farms. But, here’s a look at the rigorous testing we perform before we even leave the lab to make sure you can depend on us.
