TaskHuman's revolutionary app helps users instantly discover and connect with the world's most comprehensive, global network of specialists covering nearly 1,000 aspects of daily life, such as physical fitness, mental well-being, spiritual, emotional, financial, career & leadership coaching, and more.

With nearly 1,000 coaches from over 20 countries, TaskHuman users can get on-the-spot insight and coaching based on their specific needs for those daily moments in life when generic articles or watching pre-recorded videos just doesn't cut it. Users can enjoy 100% secure and confidential 1:1 sessions on the TaskHuman platform anytime, anywhere.

The Series A round was led by USVP with participation from new investors Madrona Venture Group and RingCentral Ventures, along with existing investor Impact Venture Capital. Prominent angel investors include Baron Davis (2x NBA All Star), Sanjay Mehrotra (CEO of Micron), Gopi Kallayil (Chief Evangelist, Google) and Somesh Khanna (McKinsey).

"With TaskHuman, every person can now engage with their own personal dream team of specialists via video call and amplify their daily work and personal lives through live human support and connection. In doing so, we also provide coaches an outlet to pursue their passion and connect with others who need their help."

"TaskHuman is reimagining personal and professional well-being and growth within a new kind of virtual services category. By putting the power of personal well-being at everyone's fingertips, we see a tremendous market opportunity for TaskHuman, and we are excited to be part of their mission."
