**GILROY, Calif., Aug. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire/** — [Scaeva Technologies](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3255034-1&h=1066878181&u=https%3A%2F%2Fscaevatech.com%2F&a=Scaeva+Technologies) Inc., inventor of a ground-breaking new approach to spatial audio rendering, enables artists to work from anywhere, on their own terms.

As one of the earliest users of Scaeva's spatial reproduction technology, Producer and multi-platinum artist Andrew Bojanic (All Good Things, Wizardz of Oz) quickly recognized the platform's potential to free independent artists to produce from anywhere. Scaeva democratized the business of music production by creating robust virtual tools for artists to professionally mix and master music without being tethered to the studio.

Although Bojanic owns a well-equipped professional recording studio, he is often surrounded by distractions – kids, travel, touring. "Being able to grab my laptop and headphones and get to work no matter where I am is huge. I even found myself checking tracks on the beach in Hawaii." Bojanic continues, "\[Scaeva's] platform is a paradigm shift for professionals and for millions of up-and-coming artists that can't feasibly create without renting a pro studio or spending thousands of dollars on gear. I wish I'd had this years ago" Bojanic's band All Good Things embarks on a 46 city tour later this month ([Tour – All Good Things](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=3255034-1&h=548908050&u=https%3A%2F%2Fallgoodthings.la%2Ftour&a=Tour+-+All+Good+Things)).

Scaeva Co-Founder and CEO, Steve Curd, indicates there are several new innovation announcements coming over the next several months.
