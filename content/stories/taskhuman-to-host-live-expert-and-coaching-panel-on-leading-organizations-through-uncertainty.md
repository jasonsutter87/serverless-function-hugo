**PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 06, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE)** — TaskHuman, the 1:1 digital coaching platform, today announced it will host a live, complimentary webinar titled "Lead and Succeed Through Uncertainty" on Wednesday, October 19, 2022 at 10 a.m. PDT / 1 p.m. EDT. Featuring a panel of three TaskHuman leadership coaches and experts, the webinar will showcase an in-depth discussion surrounding how leaders can navigate their teams through an unprecedented downturn.

Leading through economic uncertainty takes a specific set of leadership skills. It requires agility, productivity, and innovation to keep an organization sailing through the storm as revenues may fall and expenses are cut. Mastery of these defining leadership skills falls within five core competencies that are critical to successfully navigating volatile economic conditions.

Panelists include leadership coaches Nivalda Reis, Shari Jo Watkins, and Jonathan Ybañez. Moderated by TaskHuman's Head of Leadership Development Solutions Neel Jhaveri, the group will discuss:

The five core leadership competencies including building resilience, driving operational efficiency, navigating strategy alignment, leading with an opportunity-seeking mindset, and taking intuitive action
