## What is Healium and How Does it Work?

Healium is a mental fitness tool that offers you a new, active approach to meditation that is powered by your body’s electricity . Utilize real-time data to train your brain so you can self-manage your anxiety, focus more intently, and sleep better.

## Remove the Mystery of Meditation

With the power of a virtual reality headset, you can think of Healium as your journey towards mapping and training your own brain. Finally, you have a [neurofeedback device at home](https://www.tryhealium.com/2021/08/31/can-you-do-neurofeedback-at-home/) capable of boosting your mental health and overall mental fitness.

Both our [virtual reality (VR)](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3688700857882832) and augmented reality (AR) meditation apps pair with external neurofeedback or biofeedback wearable devices to train and reward your ability to calm or focus yourself.

No matter which Healium app you’re using, as you reach states of focus or quiet mind, the bio and neurofeedback wearables pick up pattern changes and power the meditation experience forward.

In other words, your body’s electricity fuels your healing experiences, while your data dashboard helps you track your progress as a whole.

## How Healium Works

Your brain is a muscle. Healium is your workout.

Healium removes the mystery surrounding meditation. You finally have data to track progress, drive motivation, and train your mental fitness.

But, data is only useful if you know how to use it!

Healium helps you [understand your brainwave data](https://www.tryhealium.com/2020/09/22/brainwaves-101-with-dr-jeff-tarrant/) by providing a baseline, a glowing firefly of your real-time brainwaves, a score after each session, and even specific brainwave band measurements in your data dashboard.

### How Our Virtual Reality App Works

Our virtual reality meditation experiences are beautiful, [nature based escapes](https://www.tryhealium.com/stories/) that have the option to be powered by your brainwaves in order to train specific aspects of your mental fitness such as your feeling of focused calm.

### Step By Step

Before you begin any training, you’ll wear the [BrainLink Lite EEG headband](https://www.tryhealium.com/2020/05/22/brainlink-lite-the-new-eeg-headband-wearable-to-power-healium/) and then put your favorite VR headset, like a Meta Quest 2, on over the headband. Healium measures your baseline brainwaves by gathering data from the BrainLink wearable. This baseline is unique to you; think of it as your “before picture”. Your baseline is a snapshot of your brain’s electrical activity without trying to change it.

You’ll always see this baseline represented as a solid white line in every virtual reality meditation experience while using neurofeedback with Healium.

As the experience proceeds, the firefly flows along the baseline based on real-time data captured from your brainwaves. The higher the firefly, the more successful you are at meeting the focus calm protocol, developed by our Chief Scientist, Dr. Jeff Tarrant.

Conversely, if your firefly dips below the baseline, the experience will dim red. That’s your neurofeedback signal letting you know you need to make some adjustments in order to shift your brainwaves into a more focused calm state. It could be as simple as taking a deep breath, relaxing your shoulders, or focusing on an element in the VR experience.

#### How to Train Your Mental Fitness in VR

The VR experience you choose in the main menu will vary based on your ultimate goal. Our content is divided into five [meditation categories](https://www.tryhealium.com/2021/06/28/the-four-types-of-meditation-styles-explained/): focus, calm, mindfulness, positivity, and sleep. No matter what you’re trying to accomplish, though, you’ll see your brainwave states represented as a glowing firefly and the solid white line as your brainwave baseline.

Let’s say you want to improve your feeling of focused calm. As the experience begins, the firefly moves higher or lower depending on the performance of your brainwaves associated with the focused calm protocol. 

To progress and make the training more challenging , you’ll simply adjust your baseline higher and keep your firefly above the baseline. As you progress through this brain training, you’ll know you’re improving when you can maintain a high score even after you’ve moved your baseline higher.

## How Our Augmented Reality App Works

You can experience the benefits of Healium without even purchasing a virtual reality headset! To train on the go (or take a quick mental fitness break during the day) all you really need is a smartphone or tablet.

### Step By Step

Our augmented reality app is compatible with iOS and Android phones and tablets. It pairs with biometric data wearables like an Apple Watch (for heart rate) or the BrainLink Lite EEG headband (for brainwaves) to determine your progress.

**Note:** Both our augmented and virtual reality apps work with the neurofeedback [Brainlink Lite EEG Headband](https://www.tryhealium.com/2020/05/22/brainlink-lite-the-new-eeg-headband-wearable-to-power-healium/).

As your heart rate lowers or brainwaves change, the augmented reality environment responds accordingly. Train your brain and experience the power of Healium as you change the colors of a beautiful jaguar, illuminate the solar system, and hatch monarch butterflies.
